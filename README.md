Date: April 2014

## Why?
The main purpose for this little project is to serve as an example and
reference point example for blog posts on my site.

## Requirements
`ttime` was written with as few requirements as possible to make it usable by
every Xymon user.

It is developed on Linux with `dash-0.5.7` and should work in any thbourne
shell.

All versions of Xymon v4.2.0+ should work (Note: for versions prior to the
renaming from "Hobbit" to "Xymon": change `$XYMON $XYMSRV` to `$BB $BBDISP`).
